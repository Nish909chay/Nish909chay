# Its me, MnM

![My Image](github-profile-pic4.png)


I’m passionate about software development and love building things that make a difference. Whether it’s a web app, a backend system, or a DevOps workflow, I enjoy turning ideas into real, working solutions.

My journey as a developer is all about curiosity and learning. I like exploring new tools, trying out ML models, automating boring tasks, and finding creative ways to solve problems. You’ll find a mix of projects here — some experiments, some full-blown apps, and a lot of stuff I’ve built just for fun (and learning).

I’m always up for a challenge, and I enjoy collaborating with others, especially on open-source projects.
